In this day and age we spend hours unconsciously on the computer. For instance, you have an essay to write, you sit down at the computer ready and then somehow five hours has passed and all you have done is binge watch an entire series of ‘Stranger Things’ on Netflix. This is a constant struggle for so many people (myself included). The Internet has changed the way we work and interact, however, the Internet also provides us with a constant distraction. If we calculated the amount of time we waste per day on the Internet we would realize we all have serious problems and maybe we should have a break from the online disruptions. The site focuses on procrastination and is specifically designed to be a giant waste of time. Using Microsoft Word as the visual layout as a start to play on the fact that although there is work to do there is always a way to be distracted and waste time.
